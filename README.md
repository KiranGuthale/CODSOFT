CODSOFT has given me the task to perform for my internship traning. 
the three tasks that I have perform are has follows:
TASK NO 1
 NUMER GAME- This program first generates a random number within the range 1 to 100. Then it prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number. It compares the user’s guess with the generated number and
 provides feedback if the guess is correct, high, or low. This process repeats until the user guesses the correct number. After a round is over, it asks the user if they want to play again. If the user 
 enters “yes”, it starts a new round; otherwise, it ends the game.
 TASK NO 2
 STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR- This program first asks for the number of subjects. Then it asks for the marks obtained in each subject. It calculates the total marks and the average percentage. Finally, it displays the
 total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
TASK NO 3
ATM INTERFACE- this program is the stm interface with options such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance(). it stores the account balance and Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
